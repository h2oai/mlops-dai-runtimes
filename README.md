# Driverless AI Deployment Templates

This repository contains different deployment templates for Driverless AI (DAI) scorers.

The structure is as follows:
* `common`: Code shared by multiple deployment templates
  * `swagger`: The shared REST API definitions. Please don't duplicate.
  * `rest-{framework}-model/api`: Modules with Java classes autogenerated from the API Swagger definition.
  * `transform`: Shared transformers between mojo and API classes.
* `{target}-scorer`: One module per deployment target.

Note: Please look to each subproject for additional deployment information.

## Build

This is a Gradle multi-project repository.
To get the resulting distribution archive, run:

```bash
$ ./gradlew distributionZip
```

The result of which is `./build/dai-deployment-templates-{CURRENT_VERSION}.zip`, which is in turn integrated in
the DAI build and deployment process.

Note that each of the templates is expected to inject its files in this archive in their respective gradle files.
Please see and follow examples in the existing deployment templates.


## Test Build

The ci process for building the above artifacts also performs linting and styling checks, and will fail if there
are any issues found. In order test this before pushing to the remote, these checks can be performed locally.

To test builds locally, with respect to linting and styling use the following steps: 
1. run `./gradlew applySpotless`
  - this will help clean the code base with proper linting/styling
2. run `./gradlew check`
  - this will run the same check as in Jenkins, to check for styling/linting errors.
  - will identify issues such as missing javadoc strings etc. 

## Release

The deployment templates zip archives are stored in S3 at: 

 - *Snapshots*:
  https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/artifacts.h2o.ai/snapshots/ai/h2o/dai-deployment-templates/
 - *Releases*:
  https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/artifacts.h2o.ai/releases/ai/h2o/dai-deployment-templates/

The push is handled by Jenkins from `master` and `release*` branches with versioning
defined by a value in `gradle.properties`. The snapshots are versions with
the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix in `version` value defined in `gradle.properties`.

The `master` branch is expected to be a snapshot (otherwise Jenkins pipeline fails).
The `release*` branches may be both snapshot and release versions.
Beware that Jenkins is happy to overwrite the release artifact, if there is a new commit
with the same version.

In addition to this, we maintain GitHub releases that mirror the released artifacts. For example
an artifact versioned `0.0.5` is tagged as `v0.0.5` with the actual release called
`Release v0.0.5`. This step is not automated yet.

### Step-by-step

1. Prepare PR with two commits:
   - First, "Release X.Y.Z" that removes the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix in `gradle.properties` form `version`.
     The diff will look like:
     ```diff
     - version = 1.2.3-SNAPSHOT
     + version = 1.2.3
     ```
   - Second, "Dev X.Y.(Z+1)" that bumps the version and adds the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix back to `version`
     in `gradle.properties`. The diff will look like:
     ```diff
     - version = 1.2.3
     + version = 1.2.4-SNAPSHOT
     ```
   - Once approved, **rebase** the PR on top of `master`, so that both the commits exist in
     the history as separate commits.
   - Create a release branch pointing to the first commit of the two, the release one, called `release-X.Y.Z`.
     Once in GitHub, Jenkins will automatically pick it up and push the corresponding release packages to S3.
   - Create a GitHub release "Release vX.Y.Z" with meaningful description, tag `vX.Y.Z`, and branch
     `release-X.Y.Z`.

### Release Lines

Currently, we have two lines of releases:

 - *DriverlessAI 1.7.x, bleeding edge*:
 These releases are meant for the latest version of DriverlessAI and contains
 the most up to date version of the templates. 
 Git branch: `master`, release versions: `1.x.y`, immutable release branch
 names: `release-1.x.y`.
 - *DriverlessAI 1.6.x, LTS*:
 These releases are meant to support the LTS branch of DriverlessAI marked as
 `1.6.x`. Changes in this branch **must not** break compatibility, so please
 keep the Terraform version fixed.
 Git branch `support-1.6`, release versions `0.0.x`, immutable release branch
 names: `release-0.0.x`.


### Upgrading Mojo2 Runtime

To upgrade the mojo2 runtime dependency version, just edit the corresponding line in the
`gradle.properties` file a push a new version of the deployment templates out as described
above.

Note that in order to be able to build against the new mojo2 runtime, the mojo2 runtime
implementation and the api jars have to be available in the public
Maven repository: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.h2o/mojo2-runtime-api and
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.h2o/mojo2-runtime-impl.

Both the steps are handled by the `DAI Build: mojo2` Jenkins pipeline:
http://mr-0xc1:8080/view/H2OAI/job/mojo2/job/master/
if the `doRelease` parameter is checked when clicking on `Build with Parameters` on
the `master` branch (again, the master should currently contain a version without
the `-SNAPSHOT` suffix).

Note that there is an extra step to push the `mojo2-runtime-api` to the public Maven repo.
One has to login to Sonatype using H2o public nexus credentials, manually `close`
the appropriate staging repository with the new artifacts (usually the first one called
`aih2o.*`, but check the contents first!), and then `release` it.
The Maven UI takes time to display the new version, but the artifacts themselves usually
appear in the order of seconds/minutes after the release (i.e., you will not see the new
version on https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.h2o/mojo2-runtime-api, but you will be
able to build against it).
